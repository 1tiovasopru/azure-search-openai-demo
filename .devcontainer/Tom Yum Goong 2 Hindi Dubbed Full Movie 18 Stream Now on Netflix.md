## Tom Yum Goong 2 Hindi Dubbed Full Movie Plot
 
The film begins with Kham living peacefully with his elephant Khon in a rural village. He is approached by an agent of Khon's owner, who offers to buy the elephant back. Kham refuses, saying that Khon is his family. Meanwhile, a group of masked men raid a camp of elephant poachers and steal their horns. They are led by LC (RZA), a crime lord who deals in illegal animal parts and organizes underground fights. He is assisted by No. 2 (Marrese Crump), his right-hand man and best fighter.
 
LC learns that Khon has a rare DNA that can enhance human abilities. He sends No. 2 and his men to capture Khon and kill Kham. Kham fights them off, but Khon is taken away by a helicopter. Kham chases after them, but is stopped by Interpol agents Mark (Petchtai Wongkamlao) and Sue Yin (JeeJa Yanin), who are investigating LC's activities. They arrest Kham as a suspect in the poaching case, but he escapes from their custody.
 
Kham follows LC's trail to Bangkok, where he encounters various obstacles and enemies, including Ping Ping (Yanin Vismitananda), a female fighter who works for LC; Number Twenty (Rhatha Phongam), a seductive assassin; and Johnny (Jawed El Berni), a French fighter who wants revenge on Kham for killing his brother in the first film. Kham also meets Sergeant Rick (Mum Jokmok), a corrupt cop who helps him for money.
