Rafael Perez Carmona is a civil engineer and a master in sanitary engineering from Colombia. He has been a professor of this subject at several universities, such as La Gran Colombia, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and Universidad CatÃ³lica de Colombia. He has also been involved in many projects and consultancies related to water supply, sanitation and gas systems for buildings.
 
In his book, he provides a comprehensive and detailed guide for students, professionals and technicians who want to learn more about these systems. The book is divided into six parts:
 
- Part I: General concepts and definitions
- Part II: Water supply systems
- Part III: Sanitation systems
- Part IV: Gas systems
- Part V: Drainage systems for roads
- Part VI: Appendices with tables, charts, formulas and examples

The book is written in Spanish and has 624 pages. It is based on the latest editions of the Colombian codes and standards for these systems, as well as international references. It also includes many illustrations, diagrams, tables and examples to facilitate the understanding of the concepts and procedures.

In this article, we will focus on the water supply systems, which are one of the main topics covered by Rafael Perez Carmona in his book. Water supply systems are the set of elements and devices that allow the distribution of potable water from the source to the points of consumption in a building. These systems include the following components:

- Water source: It can be a public network, a well, a spring, a river, a lake or a reservoir.
- Water storage: It can be a tank, a cistern or a hydro-pneumatic system.
- Water pumping: It can be a centrifugal pump, a submersible pump, a jet pump or a pressure booster.
- Water treatment: It can be a filter, a softener, a disinfection unit or a reverse osmosis unit.
- Water distribution: It can be a network of pipes, valves, fittings, meters and accessories.
- Water consumption: It can be faucets, showers, toilets, sinks, washing machines, dishwashers and other appliances.

The design and installation of water supply systems require the application of several criteria and calculations to ensure the quality, quantity and pressure of the water delivered to the users. Some of these criteria and calculations are:

- Demand estimation: It is the estimation of the water consumption for each type of user and appliance in the building.
- Storage capacity: It is the determination of the volume of water that needs to be stored to meet the peak demand and provide continuity of service.
- Pumping power: It is the determination of the power and head required by the pump to overcome the friction losses and elevation differences in the system.
- Treatment efficiency: It is the evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the treatment unit to remove or reduce the contaminants and impurities in the water.
- Pipe sizing: It is the selection of the appropriate diameter and material for each pipe segment in the system to ensure adequate flow and pressure.

Rafael Perez Carmona explains these criteria and calculations in detail in his book, providing examples and exercises for each case. He also provides tables and charts with useful data and information for the design and installation of water supply systems. He also discusses the maintenance and operation aspects of these systems, as well as the safety and environmental issues related to them.
