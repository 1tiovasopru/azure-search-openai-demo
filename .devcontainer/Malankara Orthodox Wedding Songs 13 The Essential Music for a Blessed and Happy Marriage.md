The Malankara Orthodox wedding ceremony is a rich and ancient tradition that dates back to the apostolic times of St. Thomas, who brought Christianity to India in the first century. The ceremony consists of two main parts: the betrothal and the crowning. The betrothal is the exchange of rings between the bride and groom, symbolizing their mutual consent and commitment. The crowning is the blessing of crowns on their heads, signifying their royal dignity and authority as a married couple.
 
The Malankara Orthodox wedding ceremony is also full of symbolism and meaning. For example, the bride and groom wear white garments, representing their purity and innocence. They hold lighted candles, representing their faith and readiness to follow Christ. They are escorted by their parents and relatives, representing their honor and support. They stand on a white cloth, representing their new life together. They drink from a common cup, representing their unity and sharing. They walk around the altar three times, representing their journey with the Holy Trinity.
