TeknoMW3 is a multiplayer client for MW3 that allows you to play on dedicated servers without having to use Steam. You can also play on LAN or offline mode with bots. TeknoMW3 is based on the official code name of MW3, which is IW5.
 
To use TeknoMW3, you need to have the base game files of MW3, which include the update 1.9.446 and all the DLCs. You can download them from various sources online, such as torrents or direct links[^1^] [^2^]. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive, as the game files are about 11 GB in size.
 
Once you have downloaded and installed the game files, you need to download and install TeknoMW3. There are two versions of TeknoMW3 available: SuperTeknoMW3 1.1.4 and TeknoMW3 2.9.2.0[^2^]. SuperTeknoMW3 is more stable and has more features, such as custom maps and mods support, but it requires you to register an account on their website. TeknoMW3 2.9.2.0 is simpler and does not require registration, but it has less features and may have some bugs.
 
You can download SuperTeknoMW3 from their official website[^2^], or TeknoMW3 2.9.2.0 from GitHub[^2^]. After downloading the zip file, extract it to your MW3 folder and run the launcher.exe file. You will see a window with some options and settings. You can change your nickname, language, FOV, server list and other preferences here.

Now that you know how to play MW3 online with TeknoMW3, you might want to improve your skills and performance in the game. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you become a better player:
 
- Hip fire. It's more accurate than you think, especially with steady aim. Of course, we don't recommend this for every engagement, but it saves a lot of time in close quarter engagements when aiming down sight isn't needed. It is also a great idea to master firing into aiming[^3^].
- Use cover. This might seem obvious, but many players tend to expose themselves too much and get killed easily. Use walls, cars, crates, or anything else that can protect you from enemy fire. Don't stay in one spot for too long though, as you might get flanked or grenaded.
- Reload wisely. Don't reload after every kill, unless you are sure it's safe. Reloading takes time and leaves you vulnerable. Try to reload when you are behind cover, or when you have teammates around you. You can also cancel your reload animation by sprinting or switching weapons if you need to shoot quickly.
- Use killstreaks effectively. Don't waste your killstreaks on enemies that are too far away or too well defended. Use them when they can make a difference in the game, such as capturing a flag, defending a bomb site, or clearing a choke point. Also, don't be afraid to use your lower killstreaks more often, as they can help you build up to higher ones.
- Communicate with your team. If you are playing with friends or other players who have microphones, use them to coordinate your actions and share information. Call out enemy positions, objectives, killstreaks, or anything else that can help your team win. Communication is key in any team-based game.
- Learn the maps. Knowing the layout of the maps can give you an advantage over your enemies. Learn the spawn points, the choke points, the flank routes, the high ground, the power positions, and the hidden spots. Use this knowledge to plan your strategies and surprise your enemies.
- Customize your classes. Don't stick to the default classes, as they might not suit your playstyle or preferences. Experiment with different weapons, attachments, perks, proficiencies, and equipment to find what works best for you. You can also create different classes for different modes or situations.
- Play smart. Don't rush blindly into enemy fire or chase kills that are not worth it. Think before you act and use your common sense. Don't be predictable or repetitive in your movements or tactics. Adapt to the situation and change your strategy if needed.
- Have fun. This is the most important tip of all. Don't take the game too seriously or get frustrated by losses or deaths. Remember that it's just a game and enjoy it for what it is. Have fun with your friends or make new ones online. Play fair and respect your opponents.

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you improve your game in MW3 online with TeknoMW3. Of course, there are many more things that you can learn and practice by playing the game yourself. The more you play, the better you will get.
