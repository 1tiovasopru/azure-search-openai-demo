The IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM) is a tool that allows you to remotely manage and monitor your IBM servers. With the IMM, you can access the server's console, power cycle the server, view system logs, and perform other tasks. However, some features of the IMM require a valid activation key to be installed. One of these features is the remote control, which lets you control the server's keyboard, mouse, and video output.

If you have purchased the IBM IMM Activation Key 124, you can install it on your server and enjoy the benefits of remote control. In this article, we will show you how to obtain, install, and use the IBM IMM Activation Key 124.
 
## How to Obtain the IBM IMM Activation Key 124
 
The IBM IMM Activation Key 124 is a Feature on Demand (FoD) key that you can download from the IBM Features on Demand website. To obtain the key, follow these steps:
 
1. Visit the [IBM Features on Demand website](https://fod.lenovo.com/lkms).
2. Login if you already have an account or sign up if you don't.
3. Choose the "Retrieve history" option.
4. Choose "Search history via machine type serial number" as the search type and specify the machine type and serial number of your server without any spaces. The machine type should be four digits and the serial number should be seven alphanumeric characters. For example, if your server is an IBM QRadar M5 appliance with machine type 4410 and serial number 1234567, enter 44101234567 in the search value.
5. Once values are entered, hit continue, and a list of license keys that were installed on your server should appear.
6. The FoD key you are looking for is "Integrated Management Module Advanced Upgrade" which you can mark and choose to download.
7. The file would be a .key file and would typically contain the machine type and serial number in the file name. For example, 44101234567.key.

## How to Install the IBM IMM Activation Key 124
 
There are several methods to install FoD keys on your server, but the easiest one is doing so from the IMM web interface. To install the key from the web interface, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the IMM user interface using a web browser. The default IP address of the IMM is 192.168.70.125. You can also configure the IMM to use a different IP address or share an Ethernet port with the server's management interface.
2. Choose IMM Management > Activation Key Management.
3. A list of keys that are currently installed on your server will show up.
4. Choose Add.. and browse for the FoD key file that you downloaded.
5. You will get a message indicating that the file has been added successfully.
6. After adding the file, you may consider rebooting the IMM to ensure changes are applied. This will only restart the IMM interface and has no impact on production.
7. Choose IMM Management > Restart IMM.
8. The IMM will take 3-5 minutes until it is restarted. During this time, the web UI is inaccessible.

## How to Use the IBM IMM Activation Key 124
 
After installing the key, you can use the remote control feature of the IMM to access your server's console. To use the remote control feature, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the IMM user interface using a web browser.
2. Choose Remote Control > Launch Remote Control.
3. A new window will open with a Java applet that will connect to your server's console.
4. You can use your keyboard and mouse to control your server as if you were physically in front of it.
5. You can also adjust settings such as video quality, screen resolution, keyboard layout, and encryption level by clicking on Options in the applet window.
