## How to Use Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst Plugin in Your Projects
 
Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst plugin is a simple but effective limiter that can help you increase the perceived loudness of your audio tracks without introducing distortion or artifacts. It has five modules that work together to control the dynamics of your signal: RMS compressor, peak limiter, high frequency limiter, clipper, and true peak limiter.
 
To use Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst plugin in your projects, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Cakewalk and create a new project or load an existing one.
2. Select the track or bus that you want to apply Boost 11 to and open the FX Rack window by clicking on the FX button on the track header.
3. Click on the + button on the FX Rack window and choose Boost 11 from the list of plugins.
4. Adjust the parameters of Boost 11 according to your preference and the type of audio material you are working with. You can use the presets as a starting point or tweak them manually.
5. The RMS compressor module allows you to smooth out the overall level of your signal and reduce its dynamic range. You can adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee, and makeup gain parameters.
6. The peak limiter module allows you to limit the maximum level of your signal and prevent clipping. You can adjust the threshold, release, ceiling, and output gain parameters.
7. The high frequency limiter module allows you to limit the high frequency content of your signal and prevent harshness or sibilance. You can adjust the threshold and release parameters.
8. The clipper module allows you to add some soft clipping to your signal and create some harmonic distortion. You can adjust the drive parameter.
9. The true peak limiter module allows you to limit the true peak level of your signal and prevent inter-sample peaks that may cause distortion on some playback devices. You can adjust the threshold parameter.
10. You can also enable or disable each module by clicking on its name or bypass button.
11. You can monitor the input level, output level, gain reduction, and clipping
