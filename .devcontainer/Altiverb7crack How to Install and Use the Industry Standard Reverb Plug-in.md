Altiverb 7 comes with a huge library of impulse responses (IRs) that cover a wide range of spaces and devices. You can browse through them by clicking photos of rooms in the visual browser. You can also download and install new IRs for free every month[^1^]. Some of the IRs included are:
 
- Music Spaces: The main concert halls of the cities of Berlin, Los Angeles Vienna and Amsterdam for your orchestral work. Or legendary rock studios from New York or Paris. But you can also put your audio in French Cathedrals, the Gol Gumbaz of India or London's Wembley stadium[^1^].
- Vintage Reverb Gear: Altiverb contains a tremendous amount of classic reverb gear and purpose built echo chambers. You'll find all the EMT plates you want, spring reverbs, classic digital gear like the 480, 224, the AMS RMX 16 or the EMT 240. Add the Frank Sinatra and Beach Boys echo chambers and you have everything you need to recreate all those classic sounds[^1^].
- Experimental Responses: You can use any sound as an impulse response in Altiverb 7. Try piano chords, breaking glass, spoken word, thunder or a drum loop. In convolution each sample of the input is replaced by the entire impulse response. So if you use a piano chord as an impulse Response, and you clap your hands into Altiverb, out comes the chord[^1^].
