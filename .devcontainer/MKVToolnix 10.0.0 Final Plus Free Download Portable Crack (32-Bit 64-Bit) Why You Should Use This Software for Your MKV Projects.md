## How to Use MKVToolnix
 
If you have downloaded and installed MKVToolnix, you may wonder how to use it to create or edit MKV files. Here are some basic steps to get you started:
 
1. Open the MKVToolnix application (it may show up as an "mkvmerge" executable on some operating systems).
2. Find and add files accordingly. You can drag and drop files from your file manager, or use the "add source files" button. You can add multiple files of different formats, such as video, audio, subtitle, or chapter files.
3. Select and edit tracks accordingly. You can choose which tracks you want to include in the output file, and change their properties, such as language, name, delay, or compression. You can also add attachments, such as fonts or cover art.
4. Make sure you are saving the file in the right place and start muxing. You can specify the output file name and location, and optionally enable some advanced options, such as splitting, linking, or appending. Then click the "start multiplexing" button to begin the process.

MKVToolnix will show you the progress and status of the muxing operation. When it is done, you can open the output file with your preferred media player or editor.
 
MKVToolnix also offers other tools for inspecting, extracting, or editing MKV files. You can access them from the main menu or the toolbar.
