The syllabus will tell you what topics and subtopics you need to cover and how much weightage they have in the exam. You should read only those books that are aligned with the syllabus and avoid any irrelevant or outdated material.
- **Understand the concepts**: ISC board books are designed to introduce you to the concepts and principles of each subject in a clear and concise manner. You should try to understand these concepts thoroughly and not just memorize them. You should also practice solving problems and applying these concepts in different situations.
- **Revise regularly**: Reading once is not enough to retain what you have learned. You need to revise regularly and frequently to reinforce your memory and recall. You should make notes, summaries, flashcards or mind maps of the important points from each book and review them periodically. You should also solve previous year papers and mock tests to check your progress and identify your strengths and weaknesses.
