## Basic Principles of Histology
 
Histology is the study of the microscopic structure and function of tissues. Tissues are groups of cells that work together to perform a specific function. There are four basic types of tissues in animals: epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous.
 
Epithelial tissues cover the body surfaces and line the cavities and ducts. They are involved in protection, absorption, secretion, and sensation. Examples of epithelial tissues are the skin, the mucous membranes, and the glands.
 
Connective tissues support and bind other tissues and organs. They are composed of cells and extracellular matrix, which consists of fibers and ground substance. Examples of connective tissues are the bone, the cartilage, the blood, and the adipose tissue.
 
Muscular tissues produce movement by contracting and relaxing. They are composed of specialized cells called muscle fibers, which contain contractile proteins called actin and myosin. Examples of muscular tissues are the skeletal muscle, the cardiac muscle, and the smooth muscle.
 
Nervous tissues transmit and process information by generating and conducting electrical impulses. They are composed of specialized cells called neurons, which have extensions called axons and dendrites, and supporting cells called glia. Examples of nervous tissues are the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves.

Some of the organs and systems covered in Histologia Veterinaria Dellmann Pdf 30 are:

- The integumentary system, which includes the skin and its appendages (hair, nails, glands).
- The skeletal system, which includes the bones and joints.
- The muscular system, which includes the skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles.
- The nervous system, which includes the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (nerves and ganglia).
- The endocrine system, which includes the glands that secrete hormones (pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, etc.).
- The circulatory system, which includes the heart and blood vessels.
- The lymphatic system, which includes the lymph nodes and vessels.
- The respiratory system, which includes the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
