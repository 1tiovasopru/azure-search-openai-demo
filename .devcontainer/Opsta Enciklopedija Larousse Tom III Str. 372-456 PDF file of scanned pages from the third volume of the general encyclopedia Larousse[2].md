Opsta Enciklopedija Larousse is a valuable source of knowledge and a beautiful addition to any library. It is available for purchase online or in bookstores. However, some people may prefer to download it as a PDF file for free from various websites. One such website is Scribd[^1^], where you can find a scanned copy of the third volume of the encyclopedia[^1^]. However, downloading copyrighted content without permission is illegal and unethical, so we do not recommend it.

Opsta Enciklopedija Larousse is not the only encyclopedia available in Serbian. There are also other works, such as the Enciklopedija Jugoslavije, the Enciklopedija srpske istoriografije, and the Enciklopedija srpskog naroda. These encyclopedias focus more on the history, culture, and identity of the Serbian people and their former state of Yugoslavia. They are also richly illustrated and contain many references and sources.
 
However, encyclopedias are not the only way to learn about the world. There are also other types of reference works, such as dictionaries, atlases, almanacs, and directories. These works provide more specific and detailed information on certain topics, such as languages, places, facts, and contacts. They can be useful for finding quick answers or verifying information.
 
Finally, there are also online sources of information, such as websites, blogs, podcasts, and social media. These sources are more dynamic and interactive than printed works. They can offer more current and diverse perspectives on various issues and events. However, they can also be unreliable or biased, so it is important to check their credibility and accuracy before using them.
