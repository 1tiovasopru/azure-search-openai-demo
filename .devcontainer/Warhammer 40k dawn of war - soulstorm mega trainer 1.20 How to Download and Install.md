Warhammer 40k Dawn of War - Soulstorm is not just about the two new factions, though. It also features a new type of unit: the flyer. Each faction gets access to one or more flying units that can soar over obstacles and attack from above. Some of them are more useful than others, such as the Dark Eldar's Razorwing Jetfighter that can unleash a devastating bombing run or the Space Marines' Land Speeder Tempest that can harass enemies with rockets and autocannons. However, flyers are not game-changers, as they are vulnerable to anti-air fire and cannot capture points. They also tend to clutter the screen and make it harder to see what's going on in the chaotic battles.
 
The single-player campaign offers a lot of replay value, as you can choose any of the nine factions and try to conquer the Kaurava system. Each faction has its own story, objectives, and special abilities that can affect the strategic map. For example, the Sisters of Battle can launch crusades that boost their morale and damage enemies, while the Dark Eldar can raid enemy territories and steal their resources. The campaign also features some scripted missions that add variety and challenge to the otherwise repetitive skirmishes. However, the campaign suffers from some flaws, such as poor AI, lack of difficulty settings, and occasional bugs and glitches.
 
The multiplayer mode is where Warhammer 40k Dawn of War - Soulstorm shines the most. The game supports up to eight players online or via LAN, and offers a range of modes and maps to suit different preferences. You can play classic annihilation or control point matches, or try out some new modes like Take and Hold, where you have to capture and defend a single point, or Victory Point Control, where you have to deplete your enemy's victory points by holding more points than them. The game also supports mods and custom maps, which add even more variety and longevity to the experience.
