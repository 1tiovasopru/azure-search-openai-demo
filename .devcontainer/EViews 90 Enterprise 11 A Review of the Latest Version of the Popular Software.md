# EViews 90 Enterprise 11: A Powerful Tool for Data Analysis and Modeling
 
EViews 90 Enterprise 11 is the latest version of the popular software for econometric analysis, forecasting, and simulation. EViews 90 Enterprise 11 offers all the features of the Standard Version of EViews 11, but also provides flexibility to directly connect to different data sources. Whether you want to connect to a third party provider, use ODBC to connect to a relational database, or use EViewsâ Database Extension Interface (âEDXâ) or EViewsâ Database Object (âEDOâ) Library to connect to your propriety data sources, EViews 90 Enterprise 11 is the tool for you!
 
With EViews 90 Enterprise 11, you can seamlessly search, query, and retrieve data from third-party data sources such as Bloomberg databases, IHS databases, FactSet databases and many more. You can drag and drop from a third party vendor directly into your workfile. You can also access any database with an ODBC driver, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, or Sybase. Moreover, you can develop your own customized connection to any public or proprietary data source using the EDX API, or work with data stored in EViews file formats from within other applications using the EDO library.

EViews 90 Enterprise 11 allows you to improve your work efficiency by minimizing the steps needed to bring data into your EViews workfile and improve modeling accuracy with the most recent data from your direct connection to your data source. You can also take advantage of the new features and enhancements in EViews 11, such as mixed frequency models, MIDAS regression, graph panes and stylesheets, VAR forecasting with stochastic volatility models, Bayesian VARs and VECs, panel threshold regression models, panel smooth transition regression models, panel cointegration tests and estimation methods, panel vector autoregression models and much more.
 
If you are looking for a powerful and flexible tool for data analysis and modeling, you should consider EViews 90 Enterprise 11. You can download a free trial version from [here](https://www.eviews.com/download/downloadfull_11.shtml) or purchase a license from [here](https://www.eviews.com/EViews11/Enterprise/ev11enterprise.html). You will need a 24-character EViews serial number (beginning with the characters â11â) as part of your purchase and installation procedure.
  
In addition to the data connectivity features, EViews 90 Enterprise 11 also offers a wide range of powerful features for data handling, statistics and econometric analysis, forecasting and simulation, data presentation, and programming. Some of the new features and enhancements in EViews 11 include:
 
- Interactive command explorer to view all the applicable commands for an object and its documentation.
- Name and command auto-complete.
- Mixed frequency models for estimating models with data of different frequencies.
- MIDAS regression for estimating models with high frequency regressors and low frequency dependent variables.
- Graph panes and stylesheets for creating customized graphs with multiple panes and styles.
- VAR forecasting with stochastic volatility models for incorporating time-varying volatility in VAR forecasts.
- Bayesian VARs and VECs for estimating VARs and VECs with prior information.
- Panel threshold regression models for estimating panel models with regime switching.
- Panel smooth transition regression models for estimating panel models with nonlinearities.
- Panel cointegration tests and estimation methods for testing and estimating cointegrating relationships in panel data.
- Panel vector autoregression models for estimating VARs in panel data.
