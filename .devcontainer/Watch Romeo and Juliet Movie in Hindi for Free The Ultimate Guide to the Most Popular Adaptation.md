Romeo Juliet is not just a romantic movie, but also a comedy that makes fun of the clichÃ©s and stereotypes of love stories. The movie has many hilarious scenes, such as the one where Karthik pretends to be a pizza delivery boy to meet Aishwarya, or the one where he disguises himself as a woman to enter her house. The movie also has some emotional moments, such as the one where Karthik confesses his love to Aishwarya in front of her family, or the one where he saves her from a fire accident.
 
The movie has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised the chemistry between the lead actors, the music, the cinematography and the direction. The movie was also a commercial success, grossing over 50 crore rupees worldwide. The movie was nominated for several awards, including Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Music Director at the SIIMA Awards.
 
Romeo Juliet is not the only movie based on Shakespeare's play. There have been many adaptations of Romeo and Juliet in different languages and genres, such as the 1968 classic by Franco Zeffirelli[^3^], the 1996 modernized version by Baz Luhrmann[^4^], and the 2013 period drama by Carlo Carlei. Each of these movies has its own merits and flaws, but they all share the same timeless story of love and tragedy.
  
Romeo Juliet is not just a love story, but also a story of fate, duality and violence. The movie explores how the destiny of the lovers is influenced by the feud between their families, the stars and their own choices. The movie also shows how love and hate, life and death, joy and sorrow are intertwined in the human experience. The movie uses various symbols and motifs to highlight these themes, such as light and dark, poison and medicine, dreams and reality.
 
One of the most famous scenes in the movie is the balcony scene, where Romeo and Juliet declare their love for each other under the moonlight. The scene is full of poetic language and imagery that contrast their love with the darkness of their situation. For example, Romeo compares Juliet to the sun, a bright angel and a winged messenger of heaven, while Juliet wishes that Romeo would deny his name and his family. The scene also foreshadows their tragic fate, as Romeo says that he is willing to die if Juliet loves him, and Juliet says that their love is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.

The movie also portrays the theme of violence as a result of love and hate. The movie has several scenes of fights and deaths that are caused by the hatred between the Capulets and the Montagues. The movie also shows how love can lead to violence, as Romeo kills Tybalt to avenge Mercutio's death, and later kills Paris to reach Juliet's tomb. The movie suggests that violence is a cycle that can only be broken by a greater force, such as love or death.
