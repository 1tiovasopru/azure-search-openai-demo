- **Vergil's Downfall**: A story expansion that follows Dante's twin brother Vergil after the events of the main game. Vergil has his own unique gameplay style, weapons and abilities, as well as new enemies and environments.
- **Costume Pack**: A pack that adds three alternate costumes for Dante: Dark Dante, Neo Dante and Classic Dante. Each costume has its own effects on gameplay, such as changing Dante's devil trigger form or altering his stats.
- **Weapon Bundle**: A pack that adds three new weapons for Dante: The Samurai Pack, which includes a katana, a shuriken and a shotgun; The Golden Pack, which includes a golden axe, a golden pistol and a golden shotgun; and The Bone Pack, which includes a bone scythe, a bone mace and a bone shotgun.
- **Bloody Palace Mode**: A mode that challenges players to survive 101 levels of enemies and bosses with increasing difficulty. The mode can be played with either Dante or Vergil, and features leaderboards and trophies.

The DLCs can be downloaded separately or as part of the Complete Edition of the game, which also includes the main game. The Complete Edition is available on Steam as DmC Devil May Cry - All DLCs CODEX[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. This is a cracked version of the game that bypasses the DRM protection and allows players to play without needing a valid license key. However, this also means that players will not be able to access online features such as multiplayer or cloud saves.
 
DmC Devil May Cry - All DLCs CODEX is a great option for fans of the series who want to experience the full content of the game without paying extra money. However, players should be aware of the risks and drawbacks of using a cracked version of the game, such as possible malware infection, legal issues or compatibility problems. Players who want to support the developers and enjoy the online features should buy the official version of the game from Steam or other authorized retailers.
  
The gameplay of DmC Devil May Cry is similar to the previous games in the series, but with some changes and improvements. The game is divided into 20 missions, each with a different objective and setting. The player controls Dante as he fights enemies using his sword Rebellion, his guns Ebony and Ivory, and his demonic and angelic powers. The player can switch between these modes at any time, allowing for different combos and attacks. The game also features a style ranking system that grades the player's performance based on their speed, damage, variety and flair.

The game also introduces a new mechanic called the Devil Trigger, which allows Dante to unleash his full demonic potential and gain enhanced abilities. The Devil Trigger can be activated when the player fills up a gauge by dealing damage to enemies. When activated, Dante's appearance changes to resemble his original design from the previous games, his health regenerates, his attacks deal more damage, and his enemies are lifted into the air. The Devil Trigger also affects the environment, making it more chaotic and distorted.
 
The game's graphics and sound are also praised for their quality and style. The game uses the Unreal Engine 3 to create a vivid and dynamic world that reflects Dante's inner turmoil. The game's art direction is influenced by various genres and cultures, such as graffiti, punk rock, gothic and industrial. The game's soundtrack is composed by Noisia and Combichrist, two electronic music groups that provide a mix of dubstep, metal and industrial sounds. The game's voice acting is also well done, with Tim Phillipps as Dante, David de Lautour as Vergil, Sage Mears as Kat and Lou Beatty Jr. as Mundus.
